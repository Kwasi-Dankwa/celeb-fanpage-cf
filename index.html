        <h2>Whats XO?</h2>
        <p> Some fans claim that the "XO" in the Weeknd's "XO Crew" simply stands for hugs and kisses, while others
            claim the letters represent the drugs Ecstasy and oxycontin. Considering the ubiquity of drugs in his songs,
            the latter seems likely. Regardless, he and all of his regular collaborators have the letters XO at the end
            of their Twitter handles, and his fans regularly quote their motto "XO 'til we overdose." Tesfaye has
            described his early years living away from home in Toronto as "Kids without AIDS." Having first smoked weed
            at age 11, Tesfaye moved on to painkillers, Xanax, cocaine, mushrooms, and ketamine. "I never needed detox
            or anything," he said recently. "But I was addicted in the sense of 'Fuck, I don't want to spend this day
            without getting high."</p>

        <img src="./images/dawnfm.jpg" width="250px" height="250px" alt="dawnfm" />
        <p>Starboy is starting off the year with a new universe. The Weeknd, also known as Abel Tesfaye, has announced a
            new album called Dawn FM, that it’s coming Jan. 7, and that it’s packed with an unusual cast of
            collaborators. There are a wide variety of musical styles: Quincy Jones, Lil Wayne, Oneohtrix Point Never,
            and Tyler, The Creator. And there’s also Jim Carrey.</p>

        <h2 class="mission">FunFact: He lives in a haunted house</h2>
        <p>After the somewhat disappointing release of his major-label debut, Kissland, Tesfaye was looking for a change
            of scenery and found it in L.A. Unfortunately, he insists the house he rents in the Hollywood Hills is
            haunted: "I've had sleep paralysis. I hear voices sometimes. I heard the Hills are over Indian burial
            ground. But maybe it's just the wind." Either way, when Tesfaye is in his current hometown these days, he
            checks into a hotel rather than take his chances with the ghosts.</p>
